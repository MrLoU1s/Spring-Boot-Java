The assignment is as follows:
4. Alice and her Bakery
• Create a class called CakeBaker, that is dependent on two other
classes called Frosting and Syrup. This class has a function
called bakeCake().
• Create two interfaces of type Frosting and Syrup with a
function called getFrostingType and getSyrupType respectively.
• Create two implementations of these two interfaces (so total 4
classes) for Chocolate and Strawberry flavors.
• Use Dependency injection to inject the Frosting and Syrup
dependencies into CakeBaker and also to call the bakeCake
function of the CakeBaker class.
additional thing done-loose coupling
